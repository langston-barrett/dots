* dots

These are not your everyday dotfiles! This repo hosts both per-system
configuration via NixOS and per-user configuration via Ansible.

Ansible roles aren't used to enforce minimal complexity. Ansible is only used
for symlinking and mild templating.

Anything complex or involving services/packages is upstreamed to nixpkgs.

** migration

   I'm in the midst of migrating from Ansible to [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home-manger]]. Setup currently
   requires a bit more than usual:

   #+begin_src bash :results verbatim
     nix-channel --add https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/archive/release-18.03.tar.gz home-manager
     nix-channel --update
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   It is currently only used to manage =dunst=.
