# Username. Optional. If missing, you'll be asked to provide one on
# startup.
user: langston

# Hostname: Optional. If missing, you'll be asked to provide one on
# startup.
host: mattermost.galois.com

# If the team setting is set, it must be the name of a team of which
# the user is a member. This is the team you'll automatically use when
# connecting and you'll bypass the team selection. If the setting is
# absent or isn't one of your teams, you'll be prompted for a choice of
# your teams.
#
# team: galwegians

# Password command. Optional. If this and the password option are both
# missing or give the wrong password, you'll be prompted on startup.
#
# You can also just use
# pass: password
# but this is much less secure than supplying a command or being
# prompted interactively.
#
# For OS X, the built-in security command can be used to get a password
# from the OS X keychain. To make this work you'll need to put your
# Mattermost password into your keychain as follows:
#
# * Open the Keychain application (Applications -> Utilities -> Keychain
#   Access)
# * Click the "login" keychain.
# * If necessary, click the unlock icon at the top-left corner of the
#   window to unlock keychain access.
# * Click the "+" button at the bottom of the window.
# * Enter a keychain item name (e.g. "mattermost"), your Mattermost
#   username, and your password.
# * Click "Add".
#
# Now the keychain item name can be used with the "security" command
# here:
#
# passcmd: security find-generic-password -s <password name> -w
#
# On Linux, there are a number of options.  secret-tool is part of
# libsecret (in libsecret-tools on Ubuntu) and acts as a uniform
# interface to all password managers implementing the LibSecret D-Bus
# API (including kwallet and gnome-keyring).  Assuming that you have
# stored a password using
#
# $ secret-tool store --label='matterhorn' matterhorn password`
#
# You can then set:
#
# passcmd: secret-tool lookup matterhorn password

# This optional setting controls how the client displays times. If it's
# absent, you get the default behavior ("%R"). If it's present but
# empty, that turns timestamps off. Otherwise its value is used as the
# time format string.
#
# The format string is that accepted by 'formatTime':
# https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.6.0.1/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#v:formatTime
#
# timeFormat: %R

# Notification script control: run a notification script whenever a new
# message arrives. See the "notify" script in notification-scripts/ for
# an example Linux notification script.
#
# activityNotifyCommand = /path/to/notify

# Background activity display: Matterhorn communicates with the
# Mattermost server using asynchronous background thread processing.
# This parameter can be used to enable a visual display of when and
# how much background activity is occurring.  The 'ActiveCount' value
# displays the number of queued work requests to the background thread;
# there may be multiple server messages performed for each work request,
# so this value is just a relative indicator of the amount of work
# pending for processing by this thread.
#
# Allowed values are: Disabled, Active, ActiveCount
# Default is Disabled
# showBackgroundActivity = Disabled

# The command to use to open URLs found in chat messages.
# OS X:
# urlOpenCommand = open
# Linux:
urlOpenCommand = firefox

# This setting indicates whether the URL-opening command is interactive
# in the terminal. Set this to True if your urlOpenCommand is a terminal
# web browser. Set this to False otherwise.
# Default: False
# urlOpenCommandIsInteractive = False

# Whether to show a message rendering preview
# Default: False
# showMessagePreview = False

# Whether to enable the spell checker if "aspell" is present on the
# system.
enableAspell = True

# Name a specific Aspell dictionary to use. See "aspell dicts" for a
# list of available dictionaries on your system.
# Default: fall back to environment / locale
# aspellDictionary = "..."

# Force Matterhorn to use HTTP instead of HTTPS. This is mostly included
# for testing purposes; you really should not use this unless you're
# absolutely sure it's what you want
# unsafeUseUnauthenticatedConnection = False

# The width of the channel list (in columns).
#
# channelListWidth = 20

# The maximum size of the internal log buffer, in log entries. This
# buffer is initially flushed to the log file when logging starts.
# Matterhorn keeps these log entries around, discarding old entries to
# keep the buffer from exceeding this size.
#
# logMaxBufferSize = 200

# Whether to show indicators on edited messages that have not been
# edited recently.
# Default: True
#
# showOlderEdits = True

# Whether to show the indicator for users typing and to send the typing
# notifications to the server.
# Default: False
#
# showTypingIndicator = False

# Whether to hyperlink URLs in the terminal. When enabled, this means
# Matterhorn will emit special escape sequences to make URLs clickable.
# Some terminal emulators do not support this feature, and in some of
# those cases the program's output can be garbled so this setting is
# provided for that case.
# Default: True
#
# hyperlinkURLs = True

# The list of directories from which to load Kate XML syntax definitions
# for code block syntax highlighting. The syntax is a colon-separated
# list of paths, with the highest-precedence path appearing first.
#
# Optional. If omitted, this defaults to:
#
#   USER_SYNTAX:BUNDLED_SYNTAX
#
# where USER_SYNTAX is a special path alias for
# ~/.config/matterhorn/syntax/ and BUNDLED_SYNTAX is a special path
# alias that refers to the path to XML files in the Matterhorn
# distribution relative to the 'matterhorn' binary.
#
# syntaxDirectories = /path1:/path2:/path3:...
