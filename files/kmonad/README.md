## Goals

- Reduce risk of RSI by reducing chording
- Increase speed by reducing movement away from the home row

## Observations

Besides standard letters and punctuation, I frequently use the keyboard to
control just a few programs:
- window manager (i3), via lalt
- shell (zsh), via ctrl-key and via Spacemacs/Vim-like modal bindings
- editor (helix), via Spacemacs/Vim-like modal bindings
- browser (qute), via Vim-like modal bindings
- various programs via ctrl-key (ctrl-{a,c,x,v})

## Very frequent keys

- spc: ed, shell
- bspc: ed, shell
- esc: ed, shell, browser
- ret: ed, shell
- lalt: wm
- tab: shell
- lsft: ed, shell
- lctl: shell, browser
- rght: shell
- symbols: _;./,(){}

## Very infrequent keys

- super
- spc (held)
- ret (held)
- shift (tap)
- bspc (tap)
- lctl (tap)

## Space as leader

I don't hold down the space bar, so I can use this to toggle layers.
I shouldn't introduce chording where none exists (e.g., for esc, ret).
